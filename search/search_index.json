But I think it's similar to politics elsewhere- it was never designed.</p> <p>In general, representative democracies are dependent on representatives (people who know what constituents want) being accountable (serving constituents, reporting to them and being judged by them.)</p> <p>The main component here is \"accountability\" which is a relationship. Actually, there are two important relationships, the one between the politician and the voters, and the one(s) between each voter and all voters together.</p> <p>Relationships require communication. We don't have a communication system that supports either of these, and we've never designed one (until now- see below). </p> <p>Without a designed system, poor substitutes have cropped up. Polls are the only way we know what voters want, but polls ask surprised, uninformed people who feel little responsibility to answer well and are given no time to think, ask others or learn. Plus they're expensive, infrequent and often miss important issues and solutions. Plus, most voters don't learn of the results.</p> <p>If you want to keep tabs on your representative on an issues, it's difficult- they don't report on each issue, regularly. You must depend on news or guess what their reported votes on bills mean. You can judge your representative, but no one will see your judgement and you won't be able to find others'.</p> <p>The only bit of accountability we have is that voters \"can\" elect someone new. Due to the inefficiency of political communication in general, voters are often poorly informed. Plus it make campaigns very expensive and difficult, so good people often can't afford to run, or to run an effective campaign. </p> <p>PeopleCount (peoplecount.org/how.htm) has focused on this and has designed a solution- a political communication system that allows:</p> <p>1) people to communicate with each other about what they want for their future 2) to communicate with their politicians about what they want 3) to allow politicians (incumbents as well as challengers) to communicate with voters on the issues important to them 4) to allow voters to judge these reports 5) to allow voters to share their judgements so they can effectively act together in the next election.</p> <p>None of this requires new laws or a change to existing institutions, though with its use, much will change.</p> <p>There are many more details and once people see that it can work, they have many valid concerns. </p> <p>PeopleCount is a California benefit corporation (for the benefit of society), but it's early and that is flexible. PeopleCount wants to finish the first version of its software, show it can work and then begin the process of moving issue management for a given government into a public group controlled by its constituents. </p> <p>PeopleCount's solution is not \"direct democracy\" nor \"liquid democracy.\" It's a way to make representative democracy be representative and accountable. It does not force elected officials to do what the majority wants- it DOES put pressure on them to be accountable. And the main part of accountability is answering the people.</p> <p>Note that PeopleCount is NOT funded, so is making progress slowly. It is mostly just me, Rand Strauss, and I'm happy to work with you.

We are also aware that there are other groups with similar goals and we want to carve out a niche which teams up with rather than double ups existing efforts.</p> <p>This could go in any number of directions: * A. Are we just fans of the idea who just want to talk about it for our own enjoyment? or * B. Are we trying to actually change the current system?</p> <p>This strategy assumes Option B, that we are actually trying to make a difference.</p> <p>Under Option B, here is my proposed strategy.</p> <p>Goals: * Educate and Co-operate: To educate each other, the general public, candidates &amp; political parties, and non-profit groups about understanding each other and co-operating to better serve the public need to be well represented. We promote and facilitate the sharing of ideas, particularly ideas which improve our democracy. * Non-partisan:  We will not take a particular side of politics, nor work in the system directly either by being a political party or fielding candidates to push our agenda exclusively. * Respectful: Politics often leads to heated discussion over opposing views. Opposing, controversial, and views we disagree with are okay, as long as we are all respectful about it. We are about working together and anyone of any belief (or non-belief) or background is welcome. We like to stick to the topic at hand and do not tolerate offensive behavior.  * Democratic System Reform: We want to drive healthy political interest and discourse so that we (as a country) are in position where any meaningful improvements proposed for our democracy and is in the best interests of the people has a real chance of happening.</p> <p>Core challenges: * Most (average) people don\u2019t care enough about politics at all, let alone how the system works. Without broad interest in the topic, the possibility of any proposal to improve democracy is unlikely to be ever be taken seriously if not many people even care about it.</p> <p>What are some of the major problems with the current system: * The current system (both socially and structurally) is heavily weighted towards two major parties, who can sometimes act in their own interests before the public interest. (Note: we are not against major parties, however major parties should earn votes through healthy competition, rather than by default) * A lot of apathetic voters and voters feeling powerless to make a difference due to shortcomings of the current system and political landscape * A lot of trust is placed in politicians who have a high potential to be able to abuse that trust.  * Too much trust is placed onto politicians in the first place, and there is no effective alternative when promises can be easily broken without recourse. * A lot of voters \u201cdefault\u201d to a particular party without much research of what they truly stand for, because they feel pressured to vote among a limited amount of options even though there are minor parties (which they don\u2019t know much about) on the ballot paper too. * Many voters can be manipulated into voting for a party/candidate even though that option in reality is not in their best interest to do so * Rise of \u201cPersonality Politics\u201d where voters are more interested in the person and the drama rather than the actual Policies. This is going to become more pronounced as Political Parties have realised that it is an effective strategy to get big celebrity names from the entertainment industry (like \u201cDonald Trump\u201d) to win elections regardless of policy.</p> <p>Basic strategy * \"Designing Open Democracy\" (Democratic Reform) becomes a subtopic under an Umbrella organisation (Like how Google made Alphabet Inc. and then placed itself under Alphabet Inc) * The Umbrella organisation conducts a range of activities in support of these goals * Activities can be either Direct-to-public and organisation-to-organisation. * Emphasis on Alliances/Joint ventures, not duplicating efforts elsewhere, and helping others who support our goals become stronger.   * For example, encouraging Political Parties with similar goals/policy to work together rather than cannibalise each other, or running workshops in conjunction with another group trying to achieve the same thing. * The aim is to get other people interested in us and crossover with other interesting topics as a \"Gateway\" into the topic of Democratic Reform.    * For example, Get \"Tommy\" (A video gamer who doesn't care about politics) interested in a workshop about \"video gaming and public policy\" to show how it is important to care about politics because the decision he makes when he votes affects him more than he realised. As \"Tommy\" dives deeper into the topic, Tommy starts to care and realises that his Elected representative may not be doing a good job at representing him and others in his electorate and perhaps there is something wrong with the system itself which needs exploring, so then becomes interested in Democratic Reform too. * Topics may include \"Democratic Reform\" (the end goal of why we exist) but it is not necessary for everything to be directly focused on this goal. We must also accept that some people will never be interested in this topic, and that is okay too.   * For example, we run a workshop on \"Housing Affordability\". Some people interested in Housing Affordability but also get into \"Democratic Reform\" but others might want to stick to \"Housing Affordability\" (or other side topics) only. </p> <p>Organisational Structure/Discourse Categories * \u201cCatchy Umbrella Name\u201d (ties everything together, everything flows into each other) - Names suggested to @mofosyne    * Designing Open Democracy (Democratic Structure Reform)     * Our traditional interest area   * Cooperation between organisations (Non-profits, Political Parties, etc)     * Eg: with NewVote (voting systems alignment)     * Other similar alignments work together (progressive, conservative, etc.).

Given how strongly some ppl feel about IBDD I think putting it in the delegative democracy bucket isn't great, except maybe as a hierarchical thing. Issue based specialization and trade isn't something that anything else offers, and is pretty core.</p> <p>(In future, it is likely to be possible for people to create their own bills, with votes available for each of those)</p> <p>-- Nick_Merange</p> <p>This is going to be a very early or launch feature. The votes available for member-suggested bills are not pre-parliament, but rather because those bills are seen by parliament.</p> <p>Can choose to give your vote to someone else who votes on your behalf, and you can take back your delegation at any time</p> <p>-- Nick_Merange</p> <p>This also delegates political capital. I'd say \"Voters can choose one or more delegates (so long as the total doesn't add up to more than 100%) and delegates receive the voter's resources (votes and political capital) to the proportion selected, with any \"change\" being returned to the voter. Additionally voters can optionally select to withhold an individual vote from being transferred to delegates if they'd like to vote personally.\"</p> <p>Can choose to not vote, and instead gain political capital that can be spent later on future votes (How much political capital can be saved, whether it becomes less valuable, and if so over what period is something unresolved right now as far as I can tell)</p> <p>-- Nick_Merange</p> <p>We have fairly solid ideas, but open to changes / improvements / experiments. This goes to the \"political capital\" market category of questions. Voters bid on unused votes in a market / auction system using political capital. The proceeds are then proportionally distributed to the users who opted out of that ballot.</p> <p>There are 3 ways to acquire political capital: * signup bonus, everyone gets, say, 1000 political capital tokens when joining * basic income - there's a ~30% inflation rate on political capital tokens, and all voters receive more political capital on a frequent basis (maybe daily) with 100% of newly created PC tokens being distributed in this way * opting out of issues - votes go into an auction market with the PC/vote \"price\" being decided by the market</p> <p>Plan to implement a system for bidding for political capital, where supply/demand of political capital on a particular vote determines the value of each political capital - the more people are bidding for tokens, the lower the value of each token used, and the higher value given for saving tokens</p> <p>-- Nick_Merange</p> <p>This is a core requirement, so \"plan\" is only true in the sense that we're planning all of the above. Also I think you have PC and votes backwards: supply/demand for each vote decides the value of each vote in PC tokens. The more ppl bidding for a vote the higher the \"price\" of that vote. etc.</p> <p>Have a few problems with your methodology in this section. Will respond to your reasoning first:</p> <p>Generally I think direct democracy produces worse decisions because it is vulnerable to mob mentality leading to policies created in the heat of a moment, that, on reflection, should be dealt with in a more appropriate way</p> <p>-- Nick_Merange</p> <p>This is, I think, a good crit of DD. But IBDD is anything but DD. A lot of consideration at an epistemic level has gone into thinking about how IBDD can vastly outperform existing systems. Main mechanics here are specialization and trade, opportunity cost, feedback loops, and error correction. IBDD works by having short cycle times and allowing groups to dynamically form around issues. The trade components mean making worse decisions is a sub-optimal strategy, and the ability for anyone to suggest an edit means we can facilitate fast error correction (with short cycle times). I've written a lot about this here: http://xk.io/2017/05/27/ibdd-and-poppers-criterion/</p> <p>Balancing this direct democracy approach in Flux is that it enables delegation of votes and gives political capital to people who elect to abstain from voting, meaning that specialisation of interest can occur</p> <p>-- Nick_Merange</p> <p>This is required for better decisions.</p> <p>This said, maybe that will make the system even more vulnerable to mob mentality decisions</p> <p>-- Nick_Merange</p> <p>Error correction + trade means even if this does happen it's quick to undo and mobs that form around this will waste political capital, so it's suboptimal.</p> <p>not necessarily those who are most informed or think it is a difficult issue to resolve and would prefer a more nuanced way to resolve a problem</p> <p>-- Nick_Merange</p> <p>voters are free to organise however they want, so this is out of scope for IBDD. E.g. a group of scientists can get together and use deliberative democracy to design some policy.</p> <p>I might be underrating direct democracy\u2019s effectiveness and increased the score of Flux on this metric</p> <p>-- Nick_Merange</p> <p>If you're rating DD and not IBDD then your reasoning will be flawed. IBDD is a world of difference. For example, I expect very few issues will have more than single % point participation since most issues aren't that relevant to the majority of ppl.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to settle with 4 for the moment, because I\u2019m worried about whether the optional voting system combined with the ability to gain political capital will merely incentivise emotional responses being fanned by media for people to spend this capital on their preferred response</p> <p>-- Nick_Merange</p> <p>As I explain in the article you link, this is not only suboptimal but actually a very bad strategy. Additionally, the media thing isn't comparable to situations today because right now media argue vote for party X over party Y because we need solution A not solution B; in IBDD-land the media how have to say vote for solution A over all other solutions you think might work in all other areas of politics**. It becomes personal, which is a much harder sell.</p> <p>Also, this part isn't good reasoning - you're basically saying \"because this feels right\" instead of giving a more solid argument.</p> <p>Example: can you come up with situations where self-allocation of (real world) capital is generally worse than centralized allocation of capital? This is important bc much of the economic reasoning behind why IBDD can work well is similar to explanations behind capitalist progress (which is considerable).</p> <p>I think it's funny that you give ODD a better rating than Flux considering your reasoning :P </p> <p>Also, I think it's misleading you sort of \"average\" out results based on uncertainty - if you have uncertainty you should record that. I.E. giving IBDD a 0-10 range for \"better decisions\" is more honest than a 4 since the reality is we don't know yet (though have good reasons for believing it).</p> <p>Ironically I think this is a much bigger challenge for Flux than other systems because we have a more sophisticated voting system that has more requirements around the cycle time. We've had ideas on this in the past but not settled on anything that feels \"true\" to IBDD itself.</p> <p>There is a risk for Flux\u2019s approach that stores political capital, as accessing stored cryptocurrency has been able to be exploited by hackers.</p> <p>-- Nick_Merange</p> <p>This is identical risk to any online voting system since it's about holding private keys.</p> <p>MiVote does not store capital, so is much more secure.</p> <p>-- Nick_Merange</p> <p>This doesn't relate to security in a technical sense. You could argue PC means IBDD systems are more likely to be targeted, but that is independent of the security of the platform.</p> <p>TBH I don't think you know enough about this topic to make any useful comments. You also don't consider the IP in voter anonymization SecureVote holds and that Flux will leverage.</p> <p>Might get to replying to more later, but need to do some work now.</p>","tags":["Nick_Merange","IBDD","delegative democracy","issue-based specialization","trade"]},{"location":"blog/2018/05/03/maxs-response/#evaluating-democracy-reform-proposals","title":"Evaluating Democracy Reform Proposals","text":"<p>-- Nick_Merange</p>","tags":["Nick_Merange","IBDD","delegative democracy","issue-based specialization","trade"]},{"location":"blog/2018/05/03/maxs-response/#responsive-to-crises","title":"Responsive to Crises?","text":"<p>-- Nick_Merange</p>","tags":["Nick_Merange","IBDD","delegative democracy","issue-based specialization","trade"]},{"location":"blog/2018/05/03/maxs-response/#nicks-reply","title":"Nick's Reply","text":"<p>Hi Max,</p> <p>Thanks for reading and the comprehensive response and rebuttal. It was also good to hear more of the detail of what Flux wants to do, as I wasn't sure on all the details.</p> <p>My concerns about whether Flux's approach will lead to better decisions share some characteristics with concerns I have about Direct Democracy, but they do take into account the elements your talking about. I didn't spend time addressing those in detail in my original post, but I will try and do so more now. </p> <p>Basically I think issues that are likely to have feedback loops (awareness that a policy is bad) that are weak or slow are likely to be a source of weakness for better policy under Flux's proposal, which I argue happens quite frequently.</p> <p>First, let's look closely at the idea of 'error correction'. I will define it as a process in which  - a group of people judge that a policy is bad for some reason(s) - That group proposals an alternative policy that addresses their concerns and the concerns of the original policy proponents</p> <p>I agree with your logic behind flux being more effective, but: - I don't think the feedback loops will be as strong as you think they will be - error correction will take a longer time than you're estimating. </p> <p>I also think that there are certain technical areas such as tax policy or budget allocation that will suffer until people realise that solutions that satisfy both parties by effectively paying the losing side out will have negative externalities on other areas in which people want to spend money. Let's say live cattle exports. Maybe all sides will be happy with the live cattle exporters getting compensated in exchange for not exporting live cattle. This would not be a very fiscally responsible approach, but there are few people who will care about that in the context of resolving this issue. But then more and more issues come up that have similar trade-offs, if our answer is always 'buy the losing side off', then the aggregate decisions made destroys the budget if we want to spend that money on other things. It's inequitable also if simply because the live cattle exports issue got raised first, say cattle exports get banned but they get paid out and another situation later doesn't because people identify the problem with paying out policy 'losers' by that point.</p> <p>Proposals that have small, tight feedback loops with fewer confounding factors will be the best kinds of problems to deal with under IBDD, others might take quite a bit longer. I think also you've got higher confidence than me that people will care about the policy externalities.</p> <p>I definitely think you have a strong argument and may be right that the elements and processes of political capital allocation you describe. The more I think about it the more it would make sense that people would be less antagonistic in their policy-making. I guess what I was distracted by was the fact that this won't remove antagonism from political campaigning - you'll still have adversarial politicking by two sides that want different things (e.g. Live cattle exports), but that won't influence the policy in the long run, as long as someone can actually be creative enough to come up with a solution that satisfies most of what all sides want. </p> <p>The major points of disagreement I think we have so far is about:  - The ability of people to identify 'bad policy'. You seem to be equating 'bad policy' with 'policy that is created that people don't like'. This is preference-based policy-making, but that will not necessarily create better policy, just more agreeable policy. I expect things such as mandatory sentencing laws, more police and a restriction on skilled migration will become the new policy norms, as they are already. This is aligned with people's preferences and beliefs about what dangers they perceive to themselves and how they believe they can be protected from those dangers. The only problem is that our perception of fear does not necessarily reflect the reality of how likely it is we are attacked or whether there is even any effective action that can be taken to reduce the chance of this further than is already the case. In this instance, you'll have policy that is based on placating people's feelings, rather than effective policy (maybe the best way to reduce crime is reduce inequality). </p> <p>I also do not have the same confidence in the market mechanism that you do, especially when it comes to emotional issues. Maybe it will encourage more rationality by encouraging people to instead fight the right battles for themselves. I think you mentioned that politics would become more local, not sure that's going to work great either, because sometimes we need to see the broader context - e.g. we could ban all houses above two storeys in our neighbourhood, but then if everyone does that, it will have a negative externality on utility, transportation and public service costs because density will be so low that the city will spread rapidly.</p> <p>These kinds of things are happening already in the current system, but I believe I have given plausible examples of issues that would not be resolved any better under IBDD. There will be more experimental programs that will flourish under IBDD, but I want to highlight that there may be some issues that resolve better than others under this system.</p> <p>I am worried about the aggregate effect of low percentage engagement decisions too, and I think if implemented, it will be critically important that the media analyses these proposals closely, so it avoids corruption and reduces hidden externalities.</p> <p>I will end my response there for the moment, hope that clarifies some of my thinking on this.</p>","tags":["Nick_Merange","IBDD","delegative democracy","issue-based specialization","trade"]},{"location":"blog/2018/05/03/maxs-response/#max-final-reply","title":"Max final reply","text":"<p>Basically I think issues that are likely to have feedback loops (awareness that a policy is bad) that are weak or slow are likely to be a source of weakness for better policy under Flux\u2019s proposal, which I argue happens quite frequently.</p> <p>-- Nick_Merange</p> <p>You have to contextualise this within the competition.</p> <p>Is this more powerful than direct democracy?

Analogy: as a % of population ppl working in agriculture has massively declined over the last 100 years but our ability to produce food massively increased.</p> <p>Anyway, I think you need to look a bit at your explanations and make sure the \"I'm scared of what I perceive as worst case\" theme is removed. Epistemically this is called the \"precautionary principle\" (see The Beginning of Infinity for a deep explanation to why this is a very bad philosophy). Rather, I'm claiming we're basing all this on economic principles, so the best criticisms you can offer are \"this economic arrangement leads to some bad result X\", and particularly for the killing blow you'd need to show that the ability of IBDD to self-modify with low resistance (when the idea is good, esp in cases where there are multiple IBDD instances) somehow is incompatible with fixing these problems.</p> <p>IBDD has never been put forward as \"the answer\" or a panacea.

A weakness of citizens' juries is its ability to allocate resources, which might mean that the recommendations a jury gives might be well the best option, but simply too expensive given other priorities. This can be avoided if there is a requirement that the recommendations cost the same or less than the existing policy. For example, if a citizens' jury is looking at improving the arts industry, they can't just say \"Spend more\", but must look at the structure, administration and direction of funding. Citizens' juries look particularly promising for addressing complex policy dilemmas, like how to manage the Murray-Darling River Basin in Australia or tax reform.</li> <li>Mivote I gave 6.5, compared to, say, 5 for existing democracy, because I think it is more likely than the existing democracy to create better decisions on the whole, but not quite as much as citizens' juries. This is because according to this proposal, plausible policy frames are researched, presented and voted on, with the detail of this being resolved presumably by subject-matter experts. That said, although I assume the information given out will also have some hints of what the policy approach taken (say, a humanitarian approach to refugees) might look like in practice should that approach be selected over, say, a \"border security\" approach, so there will be constraints on the policy design.</li> <li>Flux I initially gave 5, the same as existing democracy, because it just seemed highly uncertain at the moment whether it would produce better decisions or not. I changed my mind after going through the following reasoning. Generally I think direct democracy produces worse decisions because it is vulnerable to mob mentality leading to policies created in the heat of a moment, that, on reflection, should be dealt with in a more appropriate way. Balancing this direct democracy approach in Flux is that it enables delegation of votes and gives political capital to people who elect to abstain from voting, meaning that specialisation of interest can occur. This said, maybe that will make the system even more vulnerable to mob mentality decisions, as it would discourage undecided or less motivated voters from participating in a decision, which may make decision-making set by people who are most passionate, not necessarily those who are most informed or think it is a difficult issue to resolve and would prefer a more nuanced way to resolve a problem rather than simply being, say, for or against mandatory sentencing laws. So based on this reasoning, I actually think on the whole it is less likely to produce as good decisions as existing democracy, and thus lowered my assessment to 3, or 30% confident you'd get better decisions. I changed my mind again on reading the Feld and Kirchgassner paper, which finds that direct democracy elements in Switzerland seems to allow more informed decisions than representative democracy, or at least decisions more representative of the median voter's views. Based on this, I realised I might be underrating direct democracy's effectiveness and increased the score of Flux on this metric. I'm going to settle with 4 for the moment, because I'm worried about whether the optional voting system combined with the ability to gain political capital will merely incentivise emotional responses being fanned by media for people to spend this capital on their preferred response, rather than encouraging reasoned responses to complex questions. Unsurprisingly, Flux's Co-Founder Max Kaye disagrees, and argues that Flux's system will be better able to respond to mistakes and incentivise good policies being adopted, but I'm not so sure.</li> <li>I initially gave Online Direct Democracy (ODD) 2 due to scepticism about direct democracy, but having done a very basic google scholar search for 'evidence of direct democracy and decision-making', I found the paper mentioned earlier by Feld and Kirchgassner and some other results that seemed to be positive for direct democracy's effectiveness in Switzerland. My intuition is still that, on a larger scale, direct democracy might not be as effective as existing democracy given that representative democracy has embedded policy-making expertise while direct democracy does not, and also whether the political culture of the polity using the direct democracy is important. This theorising should likely be outweighed by the Swiss experience of direct democracy, so I'm giving Online Direct Democracy a 5.5, expecting it to be slightly better than existing democratic decision-making. </li> </ul> <p>Important to consider as well is the magnitude or 'how much better' the decisions will be, not just the likelihood that on the whole decisions would be better. So 8 out of 10 does not imply that Citizens\u2019 Juries decisions themselves will necessarily be a lot better than existing decisions, just that there is an 80% likelihood that its decisions would be better overall in my view.

Direct democracy approaches such as ODD and Flux score highly on this, because they can simply ask the question as soon as it happens, vote and decide. A citizens Jury would be very slow at deciding anything, though maybe some of the meetings could be expedited. Still, you need to select, inform, set the question, and give time for deliberation, and then decide. There could be an emergency citizens jury on standby to help speed it up, but overall its slower even than existing democracy, as the representatives are able to make decisions already would know the situation and have the relationships with the bodies (e.g. emergency services) that need to respond.

There is a risk for Flux's approach that stores political capital, as accessing stored cryptocurrency has been able to be exploited by hackers. MiVote does not store capital, so is much more secure. Online Direct Democracy scores low on this for the moment because they do not use blockchain for voting as far as I'm aware, but this could be readily fixed, which would enable it to become as secure as MiVote. Citizens juries are a bit more protected from tampering than existing systems, but more vulnerable than Blockchain methods to tampering, especially if jury panel members are identified publicly. </p> <p>It is worth considering whether this is in fact a large problem - in certain countries it can be, but frequency of vote tampering such as multiple voting in Australia is very low despite the ease with which it can be done, and it is unlikely to affect elections.</p>","tags":["democracy reform","technology","Designing Open Democracy"]},{"location":"blog/2018/05/03/evaluating-democracy-reform-proposals/#vulnerability-to-corruption","title":"Vulnerability to corruption","text":"<p>There is more to preventing corruption than simply reducing vote fraud - bribery, nepotism, and threats are also tools that can corrupt democratic processes.  Existing democracy has been fairly bad at avoiding small-scale corruption, but has managed to avoid large-scale corruption in Australia for the most part. As corruption has occurred, representative democracy has developed requirements for declaring political donations and has introduced or improved oversight mechanisms. This is one area where it might have an advantage over proposed systems, as they haven't gone through this process. MiVote as it stands I believe is a bit more vulnerable to corruption than existing democracy and with greater consequence to its integrity, as it is part of its system that it decides the policy approaches to present through small groups of people, including its own internal committee. This leaves it vulnerable to corruption if there is not adequate transparency and accountability for people on the committee, such as whether they have any conflicts of interest. This I believe could be addressed with transparency and registering od political gifts. Flux doesn't really centralise any aspect of its decision-making, but it's still vulnerable to corruption in my view because it makes votes a tradable commodity. Also, voters can accumulate political capital to be spent (or delegated) later, which becomes potentially a recipe for vote-buying or bribing apathetic and greedy voters. Online Direct Democracy is less vulnerable to either of these risks because it isn't centralised, has no way to give your vote to anyone else, nor can you stockpile political capital for later use. Citizens Juries are easier to corrupt than ODD if it is known which people will be on the jury, because you only need to target a small number of people.</p> <p>Arguably corruption is not something that can be addressed so much through a democratic decision-making system, but through practices of transparency that are maintained through institutions such as independent media, a strong judicial system, and external bodies keeping track of illicit financial flows.</p>","tags":["democracy reform","technology","Designing Open Democracy"]},{"location":"blog/2018/05/03/evaluating-democracy-reform-proposals/#overall-security","title":"Overall Security","text":"<p>This is the net positive average of \"Protection from vote fraud and tampering\" and \"Vulnerability to Corruption\" scores.

In any case, it is worth looking at whether there is a difference here, and there certainly is. Without a doubt in my mind Flux performs best in this area, because not only does it allow issue-based voting, but also enables voters to gain political capital by not voting and spending it on issues that really matter to them. Online Direct Democracy I gave a low score, based on a 'mob rule' or 'average median voter' models of direct democracy - either way I don't think minority views will hold much sway at all, for better or worse. MiVote faces a similar problem because I think it also goes with the majority answer in terms of the policy approach taken, but minority interests might come into play when the policy is written, depending on who writes it. Citizens Juries are slightly more likely to crush minorities than existing representative democracy as well, because they undertake deliberative decision making as a group, which is selected from a random sample of the population. Probabilities dictate that most people in the jury won't be from minority groups or have beliefs or values that are in the minority It also relies heavily on expertise, which is likely to be more mainstream than minority. </p>","tags":["democracy reform","technology","Designing Open Democracy"]},{"location":"blog/2018/05/03/evaluating-democracy-reform-proposals/#involvement-of-population-in-setting-issues-to-be-decided","title":"Involvement of population in setting issues to be decided","text":"<p>Here the direct democracy approaches of Online Direct Democracy and Flux do very well, as they both allow anybody to propose legislation in their proposals.

Flux is given a lower score because it might not be clear with the saving and delegation of political capital exactly how a certain policy became accepted, and is vulnerable to 'backroom deals' more than any other approach. Online Direct Democracy is the most transparent, as you can see what the bill is you're voting for, and then have the result determined via for or against. Citizens juries can be transparent if they identify why the topic was chosen and how the jury was selected (e.g. if it was stratified to ensure 'population representativeness, how was it stratified).

It is based to a very large degree on Stafford Beer's books Brain of the Firm and Heart of Enterprise. </p> <p>My main thrust is government organized along scientific principles which is as much to say as the application of cybernetic principles to government. Democracy is part of that and Stafford Beer, who is the father of management cybernetics, was highly regarded by the Open Democracy organisation as witnessed by the obituary published for him by Rosemary Bechler, the International Editor, of Open Democracy - https://www.opendemocracy.net/node/611   </p> <p>On the topic of democracy as part of cybernetic government, one should look at what Bechler wrote: \u2018But there again, his notion of \u201ccontrol\u201d was not quite the same as anyone else\u2019s. It wasn\u2019t authoritarian. The system exists anyway, whether it works or not. And the trick is to make yourself conscious of its workings, by seeing how things change, each time they come past you. Hence his abiding interest in appropriate feed-back loops, and his constant emphasis on the advantage to be derived from a system that gives the greatest possible autonomy of action to every level of its organisation, not just the top.\u2019</p> <p>So, my paper is my take on how government should be conducted in a cybernetic fashion. And my recent work is based on the work of Stafford Beer because he took cybernetics from the narrow scientific field of Norbert Wiener, W. Ross Ashby and others and applied it to the high-variety, chaotic systems of organizations and governments.</p> <p>I would make the comment that for open democracy one needs more than good intentions. The early communists had those and so did the anarchists. You have to have organization but the organization, in our complex, even chaotic society, has to be developed and conducted on scientific principles and one of the things here is that decision-making has to be distributed throughout the organization without causing it to disintegrate. My paper does not incorporate Stafford Beer's later work, team syntegrity, but that is simply because I have not got that far and I am more interested in legal implementation. My background is as follows.</p>","tags":["democracy reform","Flux","MiVote","sortition","open source voting"]},{"location":"blog/2018/12/18/designing-open-democracy-state-of-democracy-in-australia-in-2018/#background","title":"Background","text":"<p>Tim is a retired lawyer and town planner from Melbourne, Australia.</p> <p>Tim was one of the last generalist lawyers, educated in every field of law and he had, largely through accident, an enviably wide practical experience as both a lawyer (humanity) and town planner (science). In the sixties and mid-seventies he worked as an articled clerk and then as a solicitor with a law firm. In 1976 he took a job as a town planner in the Town and Country Planning Board studying part-time to obtain a Diploma of Applied Science (Town Planning). He then worked as the legal officer at the Ministry for Planning. In the late 1980s, Tim was employed in Constitution, Legislation and Advisings at the Victorian Crown Solicitor\u2019s Office. Then he left and joined the Victorian Bar where, as a barrister, he carried out a wide range of advocacy, advice and drafting work.</p> <p>Tim thus had an unusually wide range of experience, particularly at the Ministry for Planning. There, he was advising on and assisting in the administration of a wide range of planning and environmental statutory schemes at a time of great change and he could get some overview of their operation. In the sixties and seventies the law was less complex, less voluminous and more certain. In the town planning course Tim was taught some control systems theory by two great mentors. Tim was interested in computers and, as a member of the Micro Computer Club of Melbourne, he learnt computer programming. He studied micro-Prolog and attempted to write computer programs to solve legal issues. In the early 1990s, Tim noticed parallels in a book written by a lawyer on legislative drafting and a book written by the project manager of the IBM 360 computer and operating system. Tim tried to write a book integrating the knowledge of writing large sets of instructions (control systems) gained by the legislative draftspersons and software engineers.</p> <p>The breakthrough came when Tim found a book in the Melbourne library titled, \u201cCybernetics \u2013 Brain of the Firm\u201d by an English scientist, Stafford Beer, which enabled Tim to at least partly understand the underlying nature of control systems and enabled him to write his 1992 book, \u201cScientific Legislation\u201d. Nothing happened for over twenty years. But a few years ago, Tim was contacted by an Austrian informatics academic, who very kindly wrote, \u201c\u2026 your book is definitely the only book I know which connects cybernetics and legislation and hence is going to the root causes [of vagueness and complexity in law]. A lengthy correspondence followed and this correspondence rekindled Tim\u2019s interest in the work. Tim has since given lectures at the Parliamentary Counsel offices in Victoria and Tasmania and at Tilburg University in the Netherlands.</p> <p>Tim believes it is important that lawyers and those in government learn to understand law from a scientific, a cybernetic, viewpoint. In the 1960s, our laws were far more certain than they are now. Our society is more complex and, unless we can handle that complexity, our social, economic and environmental systems will continue to behave erratically or worse. Tim believes democracy requires a structure that enables it. Decisions need to be made on the basis of knowledge and information, not hierarchical position.</p>","tags":["democracy reform","Flux","MiVote","sortition","open source voting"]},{"location":"blog/2019/02/19/a-possible-future-topic-for-a-designing-open-democracy-panel-on-moderation-of-a-political-debate/","title":"A possible future topic for a Designing Open Democracy Panel: On moderation of a political debate","text":"<p>Here is a possible thought about what to host for the next designing open democracy conference.

Economic growth has been overwhelmingly channeled to capital, instead of wages. This situation not only aggravates our inequality problem, but it is already affecting Australia's economy (low salaries = low buying power). The best way to counter this situation is to make our unions stronger. Australia has one of the most rigid industrial relations laws among the OECD countries. The current Unions campaign called \"Change the Rules\" is about this. They need public support to change our industrial relations legislation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Australia is dumping our recycling into landfill because China and other countries are not taking our recycling anymore. We need a sustainable solution for this.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Cheers, Fernanda</p> <p>Extra Question By Brian: Thanks Fernandalila. The question is specifically asking about specific issues that effects our government ability to decide on all these issues (such as recycling policy).  So given your answer is about a specific policy, I will need to take it as a comment rather than a response. However there can be an argument that strengthening unions can at least address the aspect the economic democracy aspect of a democracy. I do ask if you have also though about co-operatives corporate structures as well and if promotion of co-operative companies is another way to address this as an alternative or in conjunction with unions. What do you think?</p> <p>Co-operatives would never replace unions in this matter. We need unions to defend the interests of the working class. Unions are necessary to level the democratic playing field which always tips towards the side with more money.  Union membership in Australia is in its all time low. Much lower than any other OECD country. There is a very strong correlation between union membership and wages / working conditions. Even the IMF (where neoliberalism goes to 11) has been issuing some reports now that recommend the revitalisation of unions as a political force. It is a really important issue and Australia's laws put ridiculous and abusive limitations to unions. </p> <p>On another note, I didn't realise the issues needed to be specifically related to democracy. I had understood that any relevant issue needing traction could serve as an experiment (laboratory) for us to try to mobilise and engage people into democratic participation. </p> <p>Cheers, Fernanda</p> <p>Response by Brian: Not a problem. I do know there is a lot of relevant issues that people are passionate about and thus your contribution is still valuable in that angle. However the philosophy of this group is that without a level and fair playing field for ideas, then good ideas will just die or get strangled by the current politics of the day. So it is in this group incentive to remain focused on the goal of a fairer and better democracy, which would require bringing together people from opposite spectrum of politics (e.g. anti-unionist and pro-unionist); And bringing them to push for a common and more fairer game. Think of pushing for better sportsmanship in a footy game after multiple matches of crappy referees and dirty sports tactics on both sides.</p>","tags":["democracy","public traction"]},{"location":"blog/2019/03/20/starting-a-democracy-forum--think-tank---is-it-needed-whats-required-for-one/","title":"20th March 2019: Starting a Democracy Forum / Think Tank - Is it needed?

Thus it is necessary to define a more concrete goal to improve the organisation's focus and ability to tackle the overal objective of improving democracy. </p> <p>At the moment the current active objective for Designing Open Demoracy is to assist members to meet and network together in the democracy reform space. </p> <p>However a current goal is to find an unmet gap in society, that Designing Open Democracy is in the best position to contribute in a positive manner. </p> <p>One suggestion of a potential opportunity is that the grassroots and the political leaders could and should be more interwoven. For example the unemployed, farmers, scientists, business owners, etc... may reflect on democracy differently from each other and thus may be more interested in one aspect over other parts of a society.</p> <p>Another aspect to consider is also the potential opportunity for NGOs and political leaders to cooperate more effectively, and Designing Open Democracy could possibly be a neutral space to promote such cooperation. </p> <p>Later discussions was about the fundamentals of how a democracy can be more open and transparent to the public as well. This could take the form of a technical reform or fundamental structural changes to the govement.</p> <p>Submission of recommendations papers and lobbying the goverment on potential reform opportunities is some capabilities that this organisation can perform.

Could be instead be more active in Lobbying the authorities to take a more proactive stance towards democracy reform? (Brian Khuu)</p> </li> <li> <p>We can involve more actors as well as studying, publishing or researching more about democracy as there is definitely a space for a potential think tank. (Fernanda)</p> </li> <li> <p>The reason behind an opaque or malfunctioning democracy is partially also due to the ill defined understanding of what democracy is within the public. Extremes exist on both sides such as a fascist government calling itself democratic. Democracy can be seen as a target, horizon or/and an achievable perfect goal. (Fernanda)</p> </li> <li> <p>Liberal democracy is currently the most efficient system. The current challenges can be tackled within the system. (Paul Ken Coghill)</p> </li> <li> <p>There are currently research on whether the compulsory voting is a good process, due to prevalance of apathetic and disaffected voters disinterested in politics even though it is compulsory. (Fernanda)</p> </li> <li> <p>The most vulnerable people are the unemployed citizens who are not having an equal say in democracy in comparison with other members of the society - a lack of voice in the democracy system despite the compulsory voting. (Paul Ken Coghill)</p> </li> <li> <p>The small groups of society should not be underestimated; structures and especially structural toxicity can be an issue to the organization. There are different ways that work in different types of organization. Open Flow- everything should be open, collaborative as much as possible. (Eric Doriean)</p> </li> <li> <p>There is a formula for failure and success in political actions. Formula is: (Robert Crouch)</p> <ol> <li>\"What needs to be done, what is going to be done\" - nothing need to be done</li> <li>\"What can be done\" - more as asking yourself. </li> <li>Asking what has to be done is a risk of failure as it connects with duty. </li> <li>Asking for what can be done is a prediction for success.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>One potentially interesting topic for a discussion panel is about how a public discussion on a controversial political topic can be more effectively moderated. (Brian Khuu)</p> </li> <li> <p>Main goals can be a reflection of concrete needs of the public. (Sylvia Poliakov\u00e1)</p> </li> <li> <p>The democracy reform spectrum can range from more governmental transparancy to full community empowerment. (Paul Ken Coghill)</p> </li> <li> <p>Take note that Australia has recently joined the Open Government Participation partnership. The goal of OGP is to enhance cooperation between government and community. (Paul Ken Coghill)</p> </li> <li> <p>New Democracy foundation facilitated this process of more connection between politics and society. (Nick Merange)</p> </li> <li> <p>The University of Canberra has created a journalistic portfolio of Deliberative Democracy called the Accountability round table - In 2006, concerns appeared that ministers on federal and Victorian state level were not held accountable. Several groups were created and were successful with the implementation of some reforms. They are still active by making submissions to the public enquiries and became incorporated. Afterwards, the structure, funding and further incorporation were created and needed. (Paul Ken Coghill)</p> </li> <li> <p>There is a real gap in the market within the grassroots and activist organisation and community groups, in terms of access to experts with the skills to navigate the necessary steps to create more submissions and recommendations to the government. This involves coordinating activities that needs to be done with the people who has the capabilities to do so. This can be done. (Julia Thornton)</p> </li> <li> <p>What can be specifically done to promote more connection between groups of society and to be involved in the community activities? We can decide what specific steps we will do. (Paul Ken Coghill)</p> </li> <li> <p>Who would be the audience, who we will attract and what brings us together? These are important questions. Journals may be solution to bring more attention but it must also be specified on what sort of journal or expertise can be fruitful for Designing Open Democracy. (Kathern Phelps)</p> </li> <li> <p>We can fulfil the gap between expertize and grassroots level- identifying issues which are discussed at the expertize level and bring attraction from the grassroots level to involve political authorities for an action or consideration. (Fernanda)</p> </li> <li> <p>Reports of the reforms of the federal public service made reference for a community engagement and were asking for public submissions or comments. A suggestion: to look at the report and make a submission regarding that report with practical suggestion. (Paul Ken Coghill)</p> </li> <li> <p>We need to find out what is the problem, what we can focus on. (Julia Thornton)</p> </li> <li> <p>We can facilitate the way in which people can stress out their issues. How can public policy influence citizens participation? The findings are that the more neoliberal the government is the more apathetic the public becomes. What impact can have for example Universal Basic Income for e.g. a higher political participation?

The ongoing research on the level of trust in systems of government around the world shows the Australia has very low levels in trust in particular with our political system. People feel they have very little control and trust. The mindset however is still focussed on the concept of political parties being the established process. The aim should be to enable people to see alternative ways in which their views could be truly represented. Given todays technology if we designed a political system from scratch now  there is no way we would end up with the concept of elected representatives within a party political system. The plebiscite is a good example of how people can express their views. We need to liberate people's minds to the opportunities.</p> <p>Engagement could be focussed on the major issues facing the country. I dont want to talk about the mechanisms by which this engagement can occur but again the technology is available by which everyone in the country could be engaged with a high level of confidence and security. I would also propose using our national broadcasters (ABC and SBS) in a formal role to facilitate the rich conversations on policy. I would also propose that climate change be a good initial topic given that there is a gap between public perception and current government policy in this area.</p> <p>I suspect the major political parties would not support these ideas as it could diminish their ability to direct policy.

Look at Uber. Yeah look at taxies, they were running for a while... then in the end the government were not popualar with consumers . And so the government goes . These guys are being operated illegally. that uber ? Yeah Uber. Well , you know what it is is it's changed that so for me I think it's important these drivers themselves are owning the platform , not some external   partners extracting values, then I am kind of okay with it, and I actually think the drivers will be better off . Whereas Problem of we got is that over time , a system like uber eats like now all the small businesses off restaurants . I think it's something like 30% that loses. systems put in place of dubious legality now that the government could be being getting donations and corruption . But there's also this popular opinion . If enough people reckon happy with with uber driver , a regular taxi then government will change the law because it be too unpopular for them , to take them , unless they make a case like in london   that this is worse for the  consumers , and then we might even think about the driver if you cannot suggest here is an error in your logic here a your because you said something about systems with system . Here is not just cars and drivers and passengers . Its roadways . Yeah . So people people a what ? Wass unlicensed taxi and to drive a flea car was a very serious offences. And what's something like doing tio people arguing that there's been so many people that are making money ? It's really driven housing crisis . It's had some impact on level homelessness . So you can go , I think , one of the broader implications of these technologies . It's difficult for governments because these technologies are also popular with people can . I just meant your conversation . I think the augment what you're looking for it's like the network effect , like how it is enough people in       Facebook . It's very hard to not use Facebook because you're just essentially shut out from a big part of society . The trouble is with control and influence like who is influenced   is not who is influencing   it. So   in terms of Uber , network allows for that . Of course , the current system is very inefficient , right , and then you leverage the technology people are happy , but at one point because the person team behind Uber and Facebook and any other platform is different from those who are   influencing the platform   by decisions they make . But an entire different group of people are influenced by that platform which our people on the ground  ' the homelessness issue and Facebook all sort of host of all sort of issues . And this disconnect is the root cause of issues which something like cooperatives would solve . A concept of commons managing public resource      as comments would also solve that when you close this loop , if if someone's influencing something , they also need to be influenced the same degree . But there has to be a connection in engineering . That's called feedback loop in the lack of a feedback loop the systems goes destablised, Yes destablised it does . And that's what we see here is the feedback loop is not cooperative . Camp is a vehicle to kind of close that loop .

We previously held a recording on the 11th of March 2020. For a warm up with Ben linkle on the talk about his party and how it implements issue based direct democracy system believe that this is a warm up, it is a bit more free flowing. However, it explores a bit more into how flux party itself works. So you may be finding this to be quite an interesting talk that goes into more details and some aspects of flexibility that the original talk did not go into. And welcome to designing open democracy and who we have here is Ben political from flux party. Hey, Brian,</p> <p>ben ballingal  0:45 thanks for letting me on.</p> <p>Brian k  0:47 Yes. So tell me a bit more about flux party and what is it?</p> <p>ben ballingal  0:54 So yeah, I'm with the flux party where a political party registered in Australia Also throughout various states throughout Australia, we're a political party that believes in or proposes issue based direct democracy. So that's a way for all the citizens, all the citizenry to vote on the issues that come up in Parliament, and have those results aggregated and shown to a representative and representatives will do what their community votes in Parliament.</p> <p>Brian k  1:28 So if I understand correctly, what you're saying is that it's gonna be a system where people will get to do a bit more direct democracy in their government. Is that correct?</p> <p>ben ballingal  1:39 Yeah, truly, it's, um,</p> <p>it's a very straight up and down democracy, the people voting on every single issue.</p> <p>Brian k  1:45 I see.</p> <p>So tell me a bit more about the history of flux. Like you mentioned, Max Cain was a big part of flux.</p> <p>ben ballingal  1:54 Yeah, so was it 2000</p> <p>middle of 2015 I believe it was. Max K and Nathan Spataro, who are the co founders came together because they had both an idea for this new form democracy. But most importantly, perhaps secondly, most importantly, they had the ability and the code behind being able to develop that.</p> <p>So they developed a prototype of</p> <p>the app and then used I guess that to generate enough buzz to get the party registered before the 2016 federal election.</p> <p>So</p> <p>yeah, at late late</p> <p>2015 would have been the the true state of flux for just the two of them</p> <p>Brian k  2:33 led to 16th Yep. Okay. Why did we choose to stop say, electronic voting, rather than say, like, What can I say? Why is there a need to switch?</p> <p>ben ballingal  2:50 I think we</p> <p>depends on your views of representative government is all my I'll stop that but for at least a lot of us in flux. Yeah, we we see the flaws in representative democracy and the government system governmental systems we have right now. And that, frankly, a lot of the flaws that we face politically, as you know, the people if we can call that come from a lack of representation, a lack of transparency, and the lack of accountability of our representatives. So generating some sort of system, especially one that's democratic and gives empowers everybody, you know, it's it's I personally, I think it's something people have been doing for the entirety of history. I was just happens to be based on blockchain tech and the internet. But, you know, technological innovation is sort of always progressed, some sort of political change. Yeah, I see. It's just something that everybody sort of felt, and this is how it manifested more than anything.</p> <p>I guess I can come in come at where like, when designing I'm from democracy, or</p> <p>what at least what I understand</p> <p>Unknown Speaker  3:54 of what you're doing because</p> <p>ben ballingal  3:57 I'm not fully across signing up. But it's Suddenly like, Yeah, for sure. So I say this is like flux is one element, if I can of</p> <p>designing and open democracy in that flux</p> <p>posit a true democratic form. It allows everybody to vote on issues right now. It's contingent on parliament, what is put up in Parliament primarily.</p> <p>Brian k  4:19 So like three year, electorial cycle,</p> <p>ben ballingal  4:23 exactly three year electoral cycle, we need to get this person in to do this thing. But what it doesn't sort of, or what what you know, will grow, hopefully symbiotically is how are people going to be informed about these decisions they're going to make? You know, how do we decide once once we've released all these old political parties of leading us? How do we decide what facets of their ideology were good? And what were bad?</p> <p>You know, and how do we actually have these discussions? That's,</p> <p>that's something that needs to grow. That's a societal you know, People need to develop this thing in in tandem with the ability to vote on issues and control their MP. So</p> <p>Brian k  5:06 what you're saying is that is flux, only one component of what is needed in the society. There's a cultural element, is that correct? Yeah, there's like I think maybe what something might have a concern is that you could try to fix the brain people. Right. But is that going to really fundamentally change this this conflict we have? Because there's also an issue of like, say, media representation, or cultural representation,</p> <p>ben ballingal  5:30 and etc. I think that's Yeah, that's the</p> <p>million billions trillion dollar question is, and you know, we don't know,</p> <p>like when we think of voting, especially nowadays, you know, we think of this voting for a team fighting for a team that has some is, yeah, this this, this tribal team that always been this way. They've always held this ideology that comes with, you know, these 50 points. So really changing how culture and society Looks at politics looks at it via every issue and how those issues actually relate individually. Yeah, you know, that's a huge cultural change. So it's a huge cultural shift</p> <p>Brian k  6:12 and mentality,</p> <p>ben ballingal  6:13 for sure. Yeah. The the actual, the actual mentality, you know, it's totally acceptable to only like one initiative that the greens put forward. And then the next week to like a one nation initiative. People could not even comprehend how that could ever work. But when you look at individual issues, you know, that greens issue could be a great environmental issue. And the one nation issue is something to do with rural infrastructure. Like they can both be right. And in today's politics, you can't that that's completely absurd. So so that's a huge change that isn't solved by be people being able to vote.</p> <p>Brian k  6:53 So I have this device to talk about, like how would the ordinary verta in Public participate in your system?</p> <p>ben ballingal  7:04 Yeah, for sure. I mean,</p> <p>Brian k  7:06 real bill, and I think a great way to ask this question would be like, could you give me a rundown as to how this system oobleck? In typical use case of the public? Yeah, for sure.</p> <p>ben ballingal  7:18 So it takes a little bit of</p> <p>the things we have to</p> <p>suspend our disbelief. First a flux MP has been voted in, in your electorate. So that's important. But you know, you're sitting on your couch in uniques. And an issue comes up, you're scrolling through your Facebook feed and an issue comes up that's being debated. You would go to the app store, or you can go to the website, either Oh, but specifically the App Store and you download an app. The app allows you to log in, create a user created a credit password, create an account and you log in using your federal electoral road details. So these are all verified by the government that you are one person then it would tell you, you know, Obviously, you're elected state level, federal level, and then the upcoming bills in Parliament. So this is going to be voted on in four days, this is going to be voted in three days. And it would allow you to vote yes, no, or choose not to vote on those ones. And then obviously, say you really like an issue, click on it. It'll give you the synopsis of the bill, maybe give you some links to the parties, like the proposing parties information, maybe some counter information proposed by other political parties. This is definitely a level where we don't want to be proposing any information. So you won't find information from flux. But you might be able to find the information that the other parties have put up. And then yeah, you would, you would vote yes or no, if you wanted to, you'd be given the results of your entire electorate, and then little button down the bottom to post to Twitter, post to Facebook, email my representative. That'd be a really basic, you know, being hit by a bill that you really cared about and acting on that bill.</p> <p>Brian k  8:57 So I'm kind of curious as to One key aspects. Gill system relies on the use of technology and smartphones and their real pretty concerns on public about the security and viability of technology based electorial system.</p> <p>ben ballingal  9:16 Yeah, for sure. It's a big tech one tech security is is something that I guess is initially very scary and especially if you know in that industry you know, I even I am quote unquote in the industry but I can't read the cook tired to</p> <p>Brian k  9:29 say like the Iowa election scandal is a scandal or kerfuffle</p> <p>ben ballingal  9:35 in America have a good turn. Yeah, that's, that's pretty perfect, cuz that exact fault was an actual fault in the code, like it been coded poorly, but it'll still in people's psyche just be an app broke and it screwed up the vote. You know that it tech gets reduced down so quickly. On a tech forefront. It is blockchain based voting. So you know, The ledger is immutable. We do have the strongest security and anonymization. In industry, you know, there is no other way. It's the same stuff that protects you bank gets your banking and all your online communication. There is a level where it's open source, you can read it. If it's got a flaw, people will find it. And right now we are telling you there are no flaws.</p> <p>Brian k  10:27 And you got to understand that like most people are probably not technologically literate in the idea of the blockchain. And so I imagine part of the aspects to getting your story out there and getting traction and the public about your flux system is you probably need to have a bit more acceptance and the idea of relying and blockchain</p> <p>ben ballingal  10:51 Yeah, it's um, it's funny, even in just three years I've been with with flux. It's even how much we have to explain blockchain. Now compared to back three years ago, is markedly less, we definitely still have to, you know, there is a certain it is still freaky new technology, but I think there's at least enough acceptance, you know, people understand crypto blockchain, it's something to do with saving and storing money. And being anonymous, like people at least have this sort of rough idea of how it works now. Yeah. And with that acceptance, you know, it's a lot easier to be like, so you can see how that could be used for voting. Yes. As opposed to having to you know, really explain how the vote worked and how the security works and how that works. It's getting there.</p> <p>It's, it's one of those ones, you really just have to put up and be like,</p> <p>it works. And you can't prove us wrong. And the people that can prove us wrong, agree with us. So what do you want?</p> <p>Brian k  11:47 Hi, and thanks for listening to this bonus content of designing open democracy. Talk with Ben Berlingo. If you're interested in this talk and you haven't had the original talk, I recommend you to Check out the last episode and give it a listen.

If a proposal receives a sufficient number of votes, reaching a predetermined threshold, it may bypass the requirement for an absolute majority vote and be approved with a simple majority. Depending on whether they guessed correctly (earning tokens) or not, players may then settle their wagers (losing tokens). If HC functions properly, it will serve as a filter for the community, which may prioritize proposals that garner interest from stakeholders. Thus, takers eliminate bad proposals, enhancing the scalability of large DAO communities. And the DAO may rely on stakeholders, as they are incentivized to align with the DAO's overall opinions, as they must predict whether the voted proposals will ultimately pass or fail. Initial studies indicate that HC operates as intended.</p>","tags":["blockchain","decentralized organization","autonomous corporation"]},{"location":"concepts/decentralized-autonomous-organization/#daohaus","title":"DAOhaus","text":"<p>DAOhaus is a platform that enables the creation of DAOs that mimic the Moloch DAO's behavior.
