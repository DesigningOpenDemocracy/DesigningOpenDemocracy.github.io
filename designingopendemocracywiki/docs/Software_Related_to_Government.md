This page will first list Open-source Software and then commercial
software in a tabular format. The columns in the table can be:

- Name and Website Link
- Country of Origin
- Link to Source Code (if open source)
- Main category (e.g. Voting)
- Main Features

For Commercial software we will first link software that is more widely
used and then other more obscure less popular software
