## Plan B

- Main goal is to look for websites that enable people to work together
  to improve politics or society in some way. We're looking for direct
  engagement and ease of entry (how easy it is to start contributing).
- Mark these websites in the list
- Ignore other websites for now
  - Take breaks; amount
  - Start with Democracy Foundation source until we find two
  - Any others to add to the team?

## Plan A

1.  Create some basic categories of websites
2.  Quickly classify smaller/insignificant websites into categories
3.  Ignore minor initiatives by single individuals and mark them for
    potential removal from the analysis
4.  Focus more on the more important interesting websites which are
    those which allow people to become easily involved in whatever is
    going on

### Categories

- Voting Platforms
- Blockchain Voting
- Deliberation/Governance Platforms
