Welcome to the [Designing Open
Democracy](https://www.designingopendemocracy.com) Wiki!

This is a repository of information on Democracy

## Idea to improve this wiki

Plugins we may want to add to make maintenance easier

- <https://github.com/wikimedia/DeadlinkChecker> : To allow for pruning
  dead links and organisations
- <https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:OpenGraphMeta> : To allow
  for other page to better render wiki page previews
