## Observations

Interesting to listen in the podcast that the researcher, who had experience engaging with extreme members during the Northern Ireland conflict and was instrumental in peace polls there, mentioned that while he could engage with Hamas leaders, he did not receive a response from Netanyahu regarding the peace poll idea. Despite this, he believes that attempting peace polls in the Israel-Palestine context is worthwhile for the long-term prospects of peace.
