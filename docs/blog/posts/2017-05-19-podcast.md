# Designing Open Democracy Meetup No. 5 - What are the Present and Future Challenges for Democracy?

Link to previous meeting’s discussion document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q2yaCWEoXkFNT2qvpBhLv0oLp--FelZXRcAvSf8wbf4/edit?usp=sharing 

Attending:

* Nick Merange
* Tom Sesselman - Software engineer
* Francisco - psychology
* David - Former police officer, guide people into constitutional law
* Kevin Woods - Working with small projects, balancing intentions, service models
* Brian - How technology works influences
* Andrew Downing - Councillor in the pirate party,




## What is democracy?
* The ability to change groups
* To achieve good outcomes, to get good input, and to have transparency of process (Think “Digital Democracy” for introducing these topics)


*Francisco's understanding:* 
* A system of Government
* *DE-mos* - of the people Kratos - rule
* *Politics* - Affairs of the city (e.g. Finding solutions for the affairs)
* Creating better things
* Democracy is best system we have at the moment

## Part of a wider social change,

* 17th Century
* “Juridical persons”, biological persons”, “informational persons”
* The power of capitalism subsumes democracy

*Francisco:* 
* Biggest issue is lack of engagement in politics
* Journalism is an important part of this engagement.
* Political exposed person - leads to people manipulating information

## “Democracy in crisis”

* Democracy vs. Populism
* Populism - Single leader who can solve all problems

## The common/social contract 

* *Brian* - Informed discussion vs. less 

### Problem with low level of Trust

* Which information do you trust?
    - Journalism as a safeguard for democracy has collapsed
    - Media monoculture
    - Online Advertising has destroyed the normal regular business models for running newspapers

* Comments by Andrew:
    - Information: Problem of scale - too much information for anyone 
    - We have to provide balance between “labour” and “capital”
    - Big economic change in developed countries

## Need for Discourse within different mindsets

* Peterson - Progressives open, lacking in conscientiousness, conservatives the reverse.
* Tom (Flux Party) - Discussion is not our responsibility as there are already experts in their field  (Importance of seperation of concerns). 
    - Governments should aim to increase prosperity

## Issues are: 
* Corruption : Corporations have a lot of power/influence in government.  
* Conflict of interest via money donated to political parties

*Francisco:*
* Crisis from the political parties
* Disappearance of ideologies (more like parties, imo)
* Disengagement from the political system
   - Why? Because of Corruption and influence 

## How do you get people who are both disengaged and more awake then ever?

We have all the ingredients to answer this question and address this positively.

* Engage youth
* Marketing, crowdfunding

Read Michel Foucault how social change occurs. People creating their own truth (youth choosing not to vote)

* Legal System is critical in this

Key issue - Accountability very important
    - Government
    - Economics

Corporations should represent everyone, not just themselves

## Summary of Challenges to Democracy

* Tom: Power of corporations too high in politics relative to Government, increasing chances for Corruption to enter.
* Francisco:
    - Political Disengagement in the public sphere.
    - Misleading information
    - Rise in Populism
    - Misalignment between goverment decision and the interest of the public
    - Must deal with the impacts of populist leaders’ decisions
    - More populism, more poor decisions
* David:
    - Remove human slavery
    - Government doing things that are illegal/unconstitutional 

* Kevin: 
    - Biggest challenge - lack of adhering to something’
    - Degree of disconnection people have with everything
    - Problem of limited accountability of corporations; they aren’t accountable to everyone.
* Brian:
    - Issue of information overload
    - Need for better represention of population informed decision.
* Andrew:
    - Trust (lack thereof)
    - Discourse between opposing sides
    - Too much information; scaliblity issues
* Nick:
    - Cognitive biases and coordination
    - Is Blockchain a “trustless” or “distributed trust” system?
