# Interesting transcription bit about gig economy

I think it is a lot of resistance against  it. , but definitely there are companies they just go out and buy a company  they'll act illegally then the laws is changed. Look at Uber. Yeah look at taxies, they were running for a while... then in the end the government were not popualar with consumers . And so the government goes . These guys are being operated illegally. that uber ? Yeah Uber. Well , you know what it is is it's changed that so for me I think it's important these drivers themselves are owning the platform , not some external   partners extracting values, then I am kind of okay with it, and I actually think the drivers will be better off . Whereas Problem of we got is that over time , a system like uber eats like now all the small businesses off restaurants . I think it's something like 30% that loses. systems put in place of dubious legality now that the government could be being getting donations and corruption . But there's also this popular opinion . If enough people reckon happy with with uber driver , a regular taxi then government will change the law because it be too unpopular for them , to take them , unless they make a case like in london   that this is worse for the  consumers , and then we might even think about the driver if you cannot suggest here is an error in your logic here a your because you said something about systems with system . Here is not just cars and drivers and passengers . Its roadways . Yeah . So people people a what ? Wass unlicensed taxi and to drive a flea car was a very serious offences. And what's something like doing tio people arguing that there's been so many people that are making money ? It's really driven housing crisis . It's had some impact on level homelessness . So you can go , I think , one of the broader implications of these technologies . It's difficult for governments because these technologies are also popular with people can . I just meant your conversation . I think the augment what you're looking for it's like the network effect , like how it is enough people in       Facebook . It's very hard to not use Facebook because you're just essentially shut out from a big part of society . The trouble is with control and influence like who is influenced   is not who is influencing   it. So   in terms of Uber , network allows for that . Of course , the current system is very inefficient , right , and then you leverage the technology people are happy , but at one point because the person team behind Uber and Facebook and any other platform is different from those who are   influencing the platform   by decisions they make . But an entire different group of people are influenced by that platform which our people on the ground  ' the homelessness issue and Facebook all sort of host of all sort of issues . And this disconnect is the root cause of issues which something like cooperatives would solve . A concept of commons managing public resource      as comments would also solve that when you close this loop , if if someone's influencing something , they also need to be influenced the same degree . But there has to be a connection in engineering . That's called feedback loop in the lack of a feedback loop the systems goes destablised, Yes destablised it does . And that's what we see here is the feedback loop is not cooperative . Camp is a vehicle to kind of close that loop . Yeah
