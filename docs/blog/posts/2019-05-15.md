This will be a series of special joint presentations with Melbourne Geek Night and Designing Open Democracy about innovative democratic startups growing in Melbourne.

One of the presentation in this event will be by Danny Johnson on his MYO Democracy platform on how he is developing an open-source platform to assist in supporting community decision making.

The second presentation by Steve Guardiani of Melbourne Business Centre is geared towards anyone interested in starting (or growing) a business and the unexpected challenges that may hit you! Steve will deliver a candid talk about some of his experiences and will include:

* **Getting burnt with SEO**
