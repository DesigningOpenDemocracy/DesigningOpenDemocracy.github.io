Hi and welcome to the Designing Open Democracy Podcast. We are an Australian based forum keeping track of democracy innovations in Australia and around the world.

For this episode recorded on the 3rd of March 2020, I visited a prominent Australian economist named Nicholas Gruen, CEO of Lateral Economics.

As frequent commentator on economic reform as well as innovation, he will be joining us for this episode to explore the concept of Citizens' Juries and how it could be implemented in Australia and other countries.
