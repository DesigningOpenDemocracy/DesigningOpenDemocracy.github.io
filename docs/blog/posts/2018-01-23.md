Are you a community leader, activist, social worker or a concerned citizen who feel that our society is becoming more polarised and that democracy is broken? Then join this meetup where we will be coming together to discuss on what does it take to build a better and more inclusive society for all. To find us, we will be at federation square at a bar named Beer Deluxe. You can find us sitting on the outside tables with a pop up poster.

The beginning topic we will cover is "Building An Open Society" and how social enterprises and community groups can come together to trade ideas related to working towards a more open society and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of their approach.

Also I have invited an organiser from a social enterprise startup named ValU to kick start the discussion, and encourage any other community leaders who are trying to start or is running organisation/companies/enterprises that are trying to approach this issue of promoting a more open society.
