PeopleCount is creating a web-based communication system to make
Democracy work. It's first target is US national politics (congress).
(After that, state and local governments, international politics, and
other nations.)

Oct 2020: PeopleCount is NOT yet available. There is a
[blog](https://blog.peoplecount.org/project/guide-peoplecount-blog/),
and a shallow, old [website](https://peoplecount.org/), even a 2-minute
[video](https://youtu.be/7TW7MaUv_8o), but the actual system is under
(slow) development. There is no team or support, currently. Just one old
software engineer with a day job.

Theory: Accountability is required for democracy to reliably work, yet
there's almost none.

Few people have

- a correct, much less rigorous, definition of accountability
- Lack of accountability causes most of democracy's problems
- Very little (often zero) accountability occurs during elections
- The media (newpapers) provide little or no accountability

Thus accountability is missing and people don't realize it's missing, so
fixing this isn't on anyone's agenda. Even more, cultural myths arise
hiding this, such as "the media provides accountability." (It also
provides very little.)

Finally, a rigorous functional definition shows that an internet-based
communication system could restore political accountability,
rejuvenating democracy and empowering citizens to govern themselves
effectively.

What accountability is: A relationship, like [between a worker and
manager, or a student and
teacher](https://blog.peoplecount.org/accountability/real-political-accountability/).

Democracy works a bit when politicians assume this is the relationship.
Since this relationship doesn't actually exist, democracies don't work
reliably. [They easily could.](http://bit.ly/pc-nuts-bolts)

In addition, we have lots of methods of communication, mostly
one-or-a-few to/from one-or-a-few, and one-or-a-few to many. But for
democracy to work, we need efficient, many-to-many and one-or-a-few
to/from many communication. This is what PeopleCount's design will
deliver.
