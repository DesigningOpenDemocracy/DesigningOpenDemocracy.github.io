### Definition

**Constitutional democracy** is defined by the ability of the majority
to wield power within the framework of the constitution, which is
designed to ensure that the majority's interests are protected. In this
sort of democracy, the constitution specifies how the people are to be
ruled and governed. Constitutional democracy is the form that works
based on and in accordance with the state constitutions.

### Types of Constitutional Democracy

- **Pluralism:** The majority of individuals are permitted to express
  their views, opinions, and concepts. It allows for widespread citizen
  participation.
- **Republican Constitutional Democracy:** It permits proceedings on
  topics that involve just the state. It includes all members of a
  state's population, but solely on matters that affect the state alone.
- **Constitutional Direct:** This confirms all of its processes and
  procedures to the state's constitution and permits direct
  participation in political activities.

### Characteristics of Constitutional Democracy

- **Popular Sovereignty:** The government gets its legitimacy and the
  right to rule from the consent of the people at large, who are the
  ultimate source of the government's authority.
- **Majority Rule and Minority Rights:** Despite the fact that "the
  majority rules," the fundamental rights of the people who make up the
  minority are always respected.
- **Limited Government:** The powers of government are constrained by
  law and a written or unwritten constitution, which those in authority
  are bound to uphold.
- **Institutional Limitations on Powers:** Certain institutional and
  procedural safeguards limit the authority of government.
