The goal of the Content Creation Project is to have short/summarized
articles on important/core topics. Articles should be factual in nature
and provide references when possible. Where possible, a section telling
people how they can get involved should be present. Any website can be
used to get information (doesn't have to be just Wikipedia)'

Charlie's Trello: <https://trello.com/b/P5xdCf43/open-democracy-wiki>

Here are some initial ideas for content (open to suggestions):

- Democracy in the work place: Community owned businesses and related
  topics (how they're formed, existing examples, what they were able to
  achieve etc). We'll be writing multiple articles, covering as much as
  possible. The goal is to inform citizens with the necessary
  information and help them learn how they can create and manage these
  kinds of organizations.
  - DAO - Decentralized autonomous organization (definition, similar
    concepts \[cooperatives\], existing examples in the real world)
  - Businesses that can be managed online or through software (e.g. a
    publicly-owned Taxi app). Real-world examples that failed or have
    been successful
  - Community business:
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_business> , combine with:
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_ownership>
  - (another website) [Community-Owned Business: How Citizens Are
    Filling Local Needs Through Shared Vision and
    Investment](https://spokaneindependent.org/community-owned-business-how-citizens-are-filling-local-needs-through-shared-vision-and-investment/)
  - Cooperative: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative>
  - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_cooperative> , Consumers'
    co-operative:
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumers%27_co-operative>
  - Legal aspects of the topic e.g. creating a business, having it
    registered and recognized for tax purposes and so on
  - Existing Examples in the real world (would be great to have a
    dedicated page on these examples)
    - bHive (in Australia). Two of their projects:
      - <https://bhive.coop/current-projects/car-sharing/> (Bendigo Car
        Sharing Cooperative) (an article on this, how it was formed,
        what its doing etc)
      - Villages: <https://bhive.coop/current-projects/villages/>
    - Any other examples
- Government by algorithm
  - sub-topics1
- Meta-page: Summary, short examples, function
- Non-partisan_democracy -
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-partisan_democracy>
- Compulsory voting (do later)
