Democracy brings together the views and interests of all citizens so
that the country's future can be determined in light of all of these
perspectives. Each country has its own democratic system; while each
country's democratic system is unique, democracy is founded on certain
fundamental principles. Moreover, it entails both the right to disagree
and the acceptance of those who disagree, as well as tolerance for
divergent viewpoints and the use of dialogue to resolve conflict.

## Origins of the Word

The term is derived from the Greek (*dmokratia*), which was coined in
the middle of the fifth century BCE from the words "people"(*dmos*) and
"rule" (*kratos*) to refer to the political systems in place at the time
in several Greek city-states, most notably Athens.

## Definition

Democracy means "*rule of the people.*" It is a form of government in
which the people retain ultimate authority and exercise it directly or
indirectly through a system of representation, that typically includes
free elections held on a regular basis. The concept of democracy has
evolved significantly over time. While the most prevalent form of
democracy today is a representative democracy, direct democracy was the
original form of democracy.

## Forms of Democracy

There are different forms of democracy such as:

- [Direct Democracy](Direct_Democracy "wikilink").
- [Representative Democracy](Representative_Democracy "wikilink").
- [Constitutional Democracy](Constitutional_Democracy "wikilink").
- Participatory Democracy.
- [Liberal Democracy](Liberal_Democracy "wikilink").
- Economic Democracy.
- Social Democracy.
- Elite Democracy.
- Majoritarian Democracy.

All terms are used to refer to various forms of democracy. While these
terms frequently overlap and are frequently incompatible, there is
almost universal agreement that democracy is a positive thing.

## Characteristics of Democracy

Respectively, elections held on a regular basis are not the only
defining feature of democracy. There are several additional principles
that must be present in order for a democracy to function properly. They
include the following:

### 1. Respect for Human Rights

The majority of democracies have a constitution outlining each
individual's human rights. They typically include the fundamental rights
that underpin democracy, such as the following:

- The right to vote.
- The right to equality.
- Freedom of speech and assembly.
- Freedom of religion.

### 2. Multi-party System and Political Tolerance

A multi-party or two-party system is critical to the functioning of any
democracy. Multiple strong political parties contesting in the elections
ensure that voters have a choice and that diverse and competing views
and interests are represented in parliaments. In a democracy, active
opposition parties investigate and debate the work of the ruling party
or ruling parties in the case of a party coalition "as in Germany." This
can help the ruling party become more accountable to the electorate.

Multi-party systems necessitate political tolerance on the part of all
individuals, including elected officials. Tolerance on a political level
entails accepting and respecting the views of groups and individuals
that differ from one's own. Individuals should be free to express their
opinions and views as long as they do not violate the rights of others.

### 3. Democratic Voting System

Instead of having one person make all of the decisions in a
representative democracy, citizens elect representatives to pass
legislation and govern the country. This is accomplished through regular
elections conducted in accordance with the country's constitution.
Democratic voting systems are defined by the following characteristics:

- Universal suffrage.
- Elections are held on a regular schedule.
- Elections are free and fair.
- Majority rule - the political party or party coalition with the most
  votes gets to govern.

### 4. Respect for the Rule of Law

The rule of law is a principle stating that public officials may only
exercise authority and make decisions if they are expressly authorized
by the law. They are not permitted to act arbitrarily or for ulterior
motives. They must act in accordance with laws that are transparent,
widely publicized, stable, and applied equally. Moreover, the process of
enacting, administering, and enforcing laws must be transparent,
equitable, and efficient. Additionally, it means that all decisions must
be made in accordance with applicable law.

Public officials cannot act arbitrarily or without being authorized by
law, because citizens are protected from the arbitrary exercise of power
under the system. The rule of law is upheld by independent courts. Only
independent courts have the authority to convict individuals of
committing a crime. Additionally, courts can invalidate actions taken by
public officials that are not authorized by law.

In conclusion, a society without the rule of law is unpredictable, and
its citizens' human rights are unprotected. The proper application of
the rule of law enables citizens to benefit from democracy's *benefits*.

### 5. Democratic Governance

Democratic governance relates to the organization and functioning of a
democratic government; what occurs between elections is critical for a
vibrant democracy. The separation of powers is a defining feature of
democratic government; state power is divided into three branches:

1.  The executive.
2.  The legislature.
3.  The judiciary.

Each branch checks the power of the other two in order to maintain a
*balance of power*. The legislature is responsible for enacting
legislation. The executive is responsible for administering and
implementing the law and other policies; this also includes the
judiciary's independence in interpreting and enforcing the law. This
check-and-balances system is intended to prevent the abuse of power.

Democratic governance should also be guided by the principles and
practices of accountability to the electorate, including transparency,
responsiveness, effectiveness, and efficiency.

### 6. Citizens Participation

Individual empowerment is the goal of the democratic system. Democracies
enable ordinary citizens to participate freely in social and political
life and to shape their society and the future of the country.
Successful democracies require engaged citizens; thus, it is about
citizens' participation in and potential contribution to democracy. In
practice, this means that you can and should participate in elections
through voting or even by becoming a member of a political party.
Additionally, active citizens monitor the performance of the government
and mobilize other ordinary citizens on critical issues. Every citizen
has a role to play in shaping a successful democracy.

- When all six of these characteristics are present, it indicates a
  robust democracy. By implementing and defending these characteristics,
  well-functioning democracies are more likely to provide the *benefits
  of democracy* (or societal characteristics).

## Benefits of Democracy

Among the benefits of being a citizen of a democratic country are the
following:

- Freedom.
- Human Dignity.
- Equality.
- Justice.
- Good Governance.
- Peace.
