### Definition

Direct Democracy is defined as rules, procedures, and institutions that
allow the public to vote directly. Citizens have more power than in a
representative democracy. In other words, people self-govern; each
individual would have a direct say in every single decision affecting
the country. It is also known as (pure democracy).

Moreover, The term is occasionally used to refer to the practice of
directly electing representatives. It may be interpreted as a
comprehensive system of political institutions, but in contemporary
times it is most frequently understood as a collection of specific
decision-making institutions embedded within a larger system of
representative democracy.
