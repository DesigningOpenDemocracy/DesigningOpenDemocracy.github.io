The other important example of employee ownership in the United States
is equity compensation, which is defined as employer-provided stock or
stock equivalents. There are several different types of equity
compensation, each with a unique structure, incentive structure, and tax
treatment. The most prevalent types are as follows:

- Stock options
- Employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs)
- Restricted stock
- Phantom stock
- Stock appreciation rights (SARs)
