In the United Kingdom, employee ownership trusts are the most common
form of employee ownership. Employee ownership trusts (EOTs) are
typically special purpose trusts that own a portion or all of a
business's stock. Typically, trusts have governance documents that
safeguard the company's character and the interests of its employees.
Employees typically receive financial benefits as a result of annual
profit sharing.
