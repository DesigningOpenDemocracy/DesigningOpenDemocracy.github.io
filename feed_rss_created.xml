I’ve worked for a while on two projects that interrelate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work professionally as a Full Stack Engineer and have for a number of years, my BS was effectively in Physics and CS, and I have partially completed an Electrical Engineering Masters which I’ve paused my studies on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One is Polari, a Research Platform intended for the Open Source audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other is a Democratic Platform approach for direct scoring and analysis of policies and by extension applicable for analysis of politicians and special interest groups involved in policy development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This platform is also intended as an alternative route towards enabling people to directly design and develop policies in a particular/different kind of Direct/Participatory Democratic method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pitch decks for the platforms and how they operate in more general terms can be found through links provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A link to the GitHub for the python backend that acts as the core of the research platform, which integrates with the democratic system, is also included. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as the front end of the research platform, which includes capability for creating new objects through a UI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my current focuses for development is getting a ‘no-code’ or ‘flow-design’ UI to work, the backend that can make this usable is already largely implemented on the python backend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The general Database design and approach along with sample calculations and methods for the democratic approach are described in the pitch deck, however much of the functionality is shared between the platforms and is re-usable between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research Platform Python Backend: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dausume/Polari-Framework&#34;&gt;https://github.com/dausume/Polari-Framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research Platform Angular Frontend: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dausume/polari-platform-angular&#34;&gt;https://github.com/dausume/polari-platform-angular&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political Scorecard, Democracy Platform Pitchdeck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/file/d/1g_Bz9I0Jxe_fe_732ClOthby0sdZSNyx/edit?usp=docslist_api&amp;amp;filetype=mspresentation&#34;&gt;https://docs.google.com/file/d/1g_Bz9I0Jxe_fe_732ClOthby0sdZSNyx/edit?usp=docslist_api&amp;amp;filetype=mspresentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polari, Open Source Research Platform Pitchdeck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/file/d/1E2P1zXEZMhpPc6tA0kpkqrdVGaNz45eO/edit?usp=docslist_api&amp;amp;filetype=mspresentation&#34;&gt;https://docs.google.com/file/d/1E2P1zXEZMhpPc6tA0kpkqrdVGaNz45eO/edit?usp=docslist_api&amp;amp;filetype=mspresentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://designingopendemocracy.com/blog/2023/09/10/dausume-introduces-his-open-source-research--democracy-platforms/</link> <pubDate>Sun, 10 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://designingopendemocracy.com/feed_rss_created.xml">Designing Open Democracy</source><guid isPermaLink="true">http://designingopendemocracy.com/blog/2023/09/10/dausume-introduces-his-open-source-research--democracy-platforms/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Deregistration of Flux Party by the Australian Electoral Commission</title> <author>Nick Merange</author> <category>Australian Electoral Commission</category> <category>Flux Party</category> <category>democracy reform</category> <category>deregistration</category> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Deregistration of Flux Party by the Australian Electoral Commission&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Flux’s website they have been deregistered by the Australian Electoral commision 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is very sad news for the world of democracy reform efforts in Australia.

We are an Australian based forum keeping track of democracy innovations in Australia and around the world. In the background of the banking royal commission starting at 2017 and the uncovering of banking misconduct by the big four banks in Australia, there is a need for the public to be able to trust that corporations will work in the interest of all stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This podcast recorded and hosted by Alexar on March 2020, was a talk by Anthony McMullen from Co-operative Bonds, explaining how we can step beyond Corporate Social Responsibility towards a corporate structure with a fundamentally more democratic economic structure. Given the situation around the world with the global pandemic in 2020, social distancing requirements meant we had to record this episode by video conferencing. So audio quality will be different compared to other episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first half of this event with be a short primer by Anthony McMullen to get newcomers up to speed about what Co-operatives is and why it matters. Afterwards a panel led by Anthony McMullen will be held to discuss about the state of co-operatives in Australia and how co-operatives can gain traction against traditional forms of business structures.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://designingopendemocracy.com/blog/2020/06/20/podcast-beyond-corporate-social-responsibility-towards-economic-democracy/</link> <pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://designingopendemocracy.com/feed_rss_created.xml">Designing Open Democracy</source><guid isPermaLink="true">http://designingopendemocracy.com/blog/2020/06/20/podcast-beyond-corporate-social-responsibility-towards-economic-democracy/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Podcast: Isegoria: The Way Citizens’ Juries Deliver It, How Elections Destroy It</title> <author>Nicholas Gruen</author> <category>Citizens' Juries</category> <category>Democracy Innovations</category> <category>Economics</category> <category>Elections</category> <category>Nicholas Gruen</category> <category>Open Democracy</category> <category>Podcast</category> <category>Podcast</category> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Podcast: Isegoria: The Way Citizens’ Juries Deliver It, How Elections Destroy It (Nicholas Gruen: CEO of Lateral Economics)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://player.whooshkaa.com/episode?id=586814&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi and welcome to the Designing Open Democracy Podcast.

And that the scorecard did not take this into account, instead trying to look for specific answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://discuss.pirateparty.org.au/t/climate-change-and-environment-policy/148/30&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A policy development tool could perhaps address this dynamic by relying on how the law covers many situation without having specific wording for every situation via the usage of &#34;precedence&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s your thought?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe there needs to be a way to have a mindmap of how each party policy flows onto specific decision.

Some of you would know that there has just been a mini-revolution: a very infirm 82-year-old President Boutéflika had won a fifth mandate as President. He seemed so sick that he would be incapable of carrying on with his duties. Boutéflika has been in power since 1999!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After massive street demonstrations, he tendered his resignation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the suffering of our Indigenous compatriots, anything we suffer in our country is 20 times worse in Algeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want you all to see this video.

Here is one food for thought... a discussion panel called &#34;Politics In Moderation&#34; where we could perhaps invite Tony from Q&amp;amp;A to discuss on how he moderates, along with other debate moderators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also much thanks to Melbourne Business Centre for assistance in providing a quiet meeting space for us&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Date: Wednesday the 20th of March 2019Time: Starting at 6pmLocation: Melbourne Business Centre, Level 9, 440 Collins Street, Melbourne Victoria 3000 (melbournebusinesscentre.com.au)&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://designingopendemocracy.com/blog/2019/03/20/starting-a-democracy-forum--think-tank---is-it-needed-whats-required-for-one/</link> <pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://designingopendemocracy.com/feed_rss_created.xml">Designing Open Democracy</source><guid isPermaLink="true">http://designingopendemocracy.com/blog/2019/03/20/starting-a-democracy-forum--think-tank---is-it-needed-whats-required-for-one/</guid> </item> <item> <title>What are the two issues relating to democracy that needs public traction?</title> <author>Brian Khuu</author> <category>democracy</category> <category>public traction</category> <description>&lt;h1&gt;What are the two issues relating to democracy that needs public traction?

If the nomination process is not democratic, then even with a democratic voting process, the outcome will not be democratic. Garbage in, garbage out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is pointed out in this lecture &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJy8vTu66tE&#34;&gt;&#34;Our democracy no longer represents the people. Here&#39;s how we fix it | Larry Lessig | TEDxMidAtlantic&#34;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to push existing parties to focus on improving their own internal democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Robert Crouch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improving the public trust on the integrity of election oversight processes and audit process. (Who watches the watcher?) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does public emotions effect election outcome? Can this be mitigated?&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;@mofosyne --&amp;gt; @Robert-Crouch I think you be interested in the discussion by Nicolas Gruen (https://discuss.designingopendemocracy.com/t/citizens-democracy-presentations-and-q-a-monday-august-21-2017/70/2), about how Vox Pop can lead to bad democratic outcome in election due to only getting a short snapshot of the public emotion that may not be a considered opinion of the public.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kenneth Coghill (Via email)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Submission to APS Review responding to &#34;Priorities for Change&#34;, advocating stronger commitment to civil society engagement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Submission to Open Government Forum urging implementation of Commitment to civil society engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What will block democratic reform?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the effect of poverty and inequality in democratic civil engagement?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Carol Campbell (Via Meetup. Slow internet)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The effect of Trump on truth, and the knock on effect to true informed Democracy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Particularly trust in democratic perticipation having any effect on society&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Peter Howard&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Education focused on the possible alternative democratic approaches. The ongoing research on the level of trust in systems of government around the world shows the Australia has very low levels in trust in particular with our political system. The aim should be to enable people to see alternative ways in which their views could be truly represented. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engagement could be focused on the major issues facing the country. And the technology is available by which everyone in the country could be engaged with a high level of confidence and security. I would also propose using our national broadcasters (ABC and SBS) in a formal role to facilitate the rich conversations on policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://discuss.designingopendemocracy.com/t/meeting-notes-for-20th-march-2019-starting-a-democracy-forum-think-tank-is-it-needed-whats-required-for-one/173/3?u=mofosyne&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fernandalila:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stagnant Wages and Union Strength:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Australia has faced stagnant wages for a decade, leading to economic growth favoring capital over wages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This situation exacerbates inequality and impacts the economy negatively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &#34;Change the Rules&#34; campaign by unions aims to counter this by strengthening unions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernandalila emphasizes the need for public support to change industrial relations legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recycling Crisis:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Australia faces a recycling crisis as other countries, including China, no longer accept our recycling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fernandalila calls for a sustainable solution to address the dumping of recycling into landfills.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra Question Response:&lt;/strong&gt; - Fernandalila dismisses the idea that co-operatives can replace unions and asserts the necessity of unions to defend the working class. - She highlights the correlation between union membership and favorable wages/working conditions. - Acknowledges the importance of revitalizing unions and criticizes Australia&#39;s laws limiting union activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response to Brian&#39;s Clarification:&lt;/strong&gt; - Fernandalila expresses understanding and notes her interpretation that any relevant issue needing traction can serve as an experiment for democratic participation. - Acknowledges the group&#39;s focus on a fair playing field for ideas, highlighting the need for a more equitable and better democracy. - Stresses the importance of bringing together people from opposing political spectrums to push for a fairer game, akin to improving sportsmanship in a football game.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://designingopendemocracy.com/blog/2019/03/19/what-are-the-two-issues-relating-to-democracy-that-needs-public-traction/</link> <pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="http://designingopendemocracy.com/feed_rss_created.xml">Designing Open Democracy</source><guid isPermaLink="true">http://designingopendemocracy.com/blog/2019/03/19/what-are-the-two-issues-relating-to-democracy-that-needs-public-traction/</guid> </item> <item> <title>A possible future topic for a Designing Open Democracy Panel: On moderation of a political debate</title> <category>Designing Open Democracy Panel</category> <category>moderation</category> <category>panel discussion</category> <category>political debate</category> <description>&lt;h1&gt;A possible future topic for a Designing Open Democracy Panel: On moderation of a political debate&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a possible thought about what to host for the next designing open democracy conference.
