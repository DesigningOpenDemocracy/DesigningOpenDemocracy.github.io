[Democracy](/What_is_Democracy "wikilink") does not happen without
various infrastructure in place to support it. Currently the processes,
tools and objects associated with democracy are:

- People
- Voting
- Participation (cf. "Ladder of participation"), (information to
  citizens, consultation, negotiation, design with residents)
- information
- Separation of Powers
- Parliaments (this is likely one aspect of democracy that may become
  obsolete, but it is essentially a forum for each person to raise an
  issue and their position on it)
