## Methods for Searching for More Links

1.  Search for links that contain links to other websites. For example
    if you find one website that has a link to Website 'A', it might
    also have websites B and C. To search for any website that contains
    a link to Website A, search this in Google:
    link:www.whoshallivotefor.com
2.  You can visit Website 'A' to see if it has links to other websites
